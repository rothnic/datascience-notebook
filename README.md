Data Science Notebook
---------------------
Builds on Anaconda-Notebook by adding R, and adding the R IPython Notebook kernel. This provides the option to use Python 2, Python 3, or R from the same interface.

From the IPython Notebook window, a R kernel will be available on the dropdown menu for creating a new notebook.

See [Anaconda-Notebook](https://github.com/rothnic/anaconda-notebook) for instructions on use.
